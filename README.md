key-value data store using python 3:


The aim of this project is to Build a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete)
operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one
laptop. The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work
with the data store.
